        Hello and thank you for taking part in this experiment.

        In this experiment you will watch some animations and will be asked to synchronize the onset of a flash on screen with the movement of one of the animation elements.

        Whenever you are ready, click next.

         In the following screen, you will watch some animations in order to learn how different elements interact. Please watch carefully.

         Afterwards, you will be asked to predict how an animation will end.

        In future you will have to synchronize a slider with the onset of some movement. In the next screen you can see how that works.

        Now, we are ready to start. You will now see an animation involving different squares. You will be asked to synchronize the flash on the screen with the moment the blue square starts moving.
        As you saw before, you can change the moment the flash appears on screen by moving the slider.
