        Hello and thank you for taking part in our experiment.

        In the next few pages we will present you with a novel smart product and explain how it works. We will then ask you some questions about it.

        After that, we will ask you to read a story related to the product and answer some more questions.

        What we need you to do you, is to read the product description carefully and consider how likely are you to buy it. Then you should read the associated scenario and carefully answer the questions that follow.
        Please click next when youâ€™re ready to start.
