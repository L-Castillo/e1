        Hello and thank you for taking part in this experiment.

        In this experiment you will watch some animations and perform a task for each of them.


        Whenever you are ready, click next to see more detailed instructions and make sure you read them carefully.

    </instructions>


    <instructions process ="{true}">
        <b style="color:red">WARNING: This experiment contains flashing lights.</b>

        If you believe you will be affected please leave the experiment now.

         In the following screen, you will watch some animations in order to learn how different objects interact. Please watch carefully.

         Afterwards, you will be asked to predict how an animation will end.

    <instructions process="{true}">
        In the next few trials, the screen will flash and we will ask you to change the time at which the flashing appears.
        To do so, you will use a slider, moving it left to make it appear earlier and moving it right to make it appear later.
        In the next screen you can see how that works.
    </instructions>

    <slider-practice></slider-practice>

    <instructions process = "{true}">
        This is the end of the instructions.

        Next you will see an animation involving different objects and will be asked the order when you expect they will start moving.
    </instructions>

    <expectations2></expectations2>

    <instructions>
        Next you will be asked to synchronize the flash on the screen with the time when the blue square starts moving.
        As you learned before, you can change the moment the flash appears on screen by moving the slider.
